Getting Started With poropy
===========================

Background
----------

:mod:`poropy` is a set of simple tools related to optimization of
incore fuel management.  This includes loading pattern optimization,
for which :mod:`poropy.coretools` provides several tools.  For 
optimizing bundles (enrichment, gad content, etc.), :mod:`poropy.bundletools`
will provide utilities.

Building poropy
---------------

For now, it's simple enough to set ``PYTHONPATH`` correctly.  In the future,
a ``setup.py`` script will be included.

Next Steps
----------

The user is encouraged to see the collection of 
:ref:`sec_examples`, which
includes optimization of a simple core.
